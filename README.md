Hi I'm Cassio, 

- I'm a Frontend Developer passionate about creating responsive applications. Currently working as a freelancer, I use JavaScript as my main programming language and modern technologies and frameworks like React, tailwind CSS, Nextjs to build visually appealing solutions that adapt seamlessly across devices.

 - I’m deeply interested in technology and love turning visual designs into functional interfaces. 

- I enjoy learning by doing, constantly building projects, exploring new tools, frameworks and improving my skills.

-  I’m always looking for ways to grow and collaborate with others in the tech space.`
