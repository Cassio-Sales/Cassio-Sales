Hello I'm Cassio, 

- I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on Frontend Development. I'm building my own Micro SaaS, an interactive app that encourages kids to read in a fun and engaging way using AI. I use JavaScript as my main programming language and modern technologies and frameworks like React, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js to build visually appealing solutions that adapt seamlessly across devices, with attention to UI and UX principles.

- I'm constantly building projects, exploring new tools and frameworks, and improving my skills.
